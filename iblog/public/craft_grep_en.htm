	<h2>Grep tool for Windows.</h2>
     Some time before I had to find some strings in logs. If we talk about Windows there are some apps to help us with this task: TotalCommander's lister or Notepad++. But what if you want to have all the necessary strings and only them? Of cause you can install unixtools and use grep command or Windows' findstr from cmd. I wanted to create something useful after I had read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Guide-Herbert-Schildt/dp/0071809252/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">thick Java book of Herbert Schildt </a> as an exercise. In the end I had a small app which finds strings containing search string in the file of all files in the folder. Project has beed created in NetBeans.</br>
    <b>Important points: </b>
    <ul>
		<li> I developed a multithread version but after tests on different machines left it as is
	</ul>
	<b>Features:</b>
	<ul>
		<li> find both Russian and Englis strings </li>
		<li> is able to find in the file or in all files of the folder </li>
		<li> is able to find regular expressions </li>
	</ul>
